##test/download

What's in this repo is the app. Bower, node components are gitignored.

You'll need to have installed bower, node, grunt.

Fork the repo. Clone a branch.

In the root directory fire:

        bower install


then:

        npm install


If you have problems with npm install you may need to clear the cache and try again:

        npm cache clear


Finally, run the app on the local server:

        grunt serve

To build:

        grunt build
  
If you need to add a library or plugin, use bower.

For example:

        bower install --save jquery
